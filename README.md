This senior thesis project presents The Perfect Chai Maker, a machine capable of making masala chai, a South Asian tea beverage, automatically. Chai is a method of making tea rather an a flavour itself. With an increasing demand for chai in the American and European market, prod- ucts have failed to replicate the traditional recipe or to improve on the inconvenience currently associated with making chai â€“ such as time taken for preparation of the ingredients and super- vising the recipe when on the heat. This machine follows strict tolerances based on a modified version of a chai recipe to replicate a traditional cup of chai. The milk is inserted to the machine by the user though it self dispenses ingredients and hot water, taking a total of less than 5 min- utes to operate. Most of the specifications were met for the machine.
Please note that the concluding three weeks of this project were cut short due to com- plications related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
